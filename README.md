yiiframework.com Website
========================

This project contains the source code for the [yiiframework.com](http://yiiframework.com/) Website.

If you want to contribute please get in touch with us using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/yiisoft-contrib/yiiframework.com/issues).
We will set up some contribution guidelines soon.


## INSTALLATION

Before you start, make sure you have installed [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
If you are on Debian or Ubuntu you might also want to install the [libnotify-bin](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libnotify-bin) package,
which is used by Gulp to inform you about its status.

If you intend to use the [Pageres client](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli) to generate screen shots for testing purposes, you need to install the `pageres.cli` tool globally:

~~~
npm install --global pageres-cli
~~~

And then you can use the script `run_pageres.sh` at the root of the source directory to generate screen shots.


### Installation instructions

```
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/yiisoft-contrib/yiiframework.com.git

cd yiiframework.com

# install the composer asset plugin globally, if you haven't done so before
composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.4.2"

# install the dependent composer packages
composer install

# install gulp globally if you haven't done so before
yarn global add gulp-cli

# install dependent NPM modules
yarn install

# initialize the application, choose "development"
./init
```

Configure database connection in `config/params-local.php`. You may copy-paste and adjust `components.db` from
`config/params.php`. Make sure to configure the following properties:

```
'api.baseUrl' => '/doc/api',
'guide.baseUrl' => '/doc/guide',
'components.db' => [
    // copy from params.php and adjust to your environment
],
'components.elasticsearch' => [
    // copy from params.php and adjust to your environment
],
// only if you want to test github auth:
'authclients' => [
    'github' => [
        'class' => 'yii\authclient\clients\GitHub',
        'clientId' => '...', // register an oauth app on github and enter details here
        'clientSecret' => '...',
        'scope' => 'user:email',
    ],
],
'siteAbsoluteUrl' => 'http://yiiframework.local',

/**
 * @see https://apps.twitter.com/app/new
 *
 * After creating an app you need to fill accessToken and accessTokenSecret:
 *
 * Open App -> Keys and Access Tokens -> You Access Token -> Create my access token
 */
'twitter.consumerKey' => '',
'twitter.consumerSecret' => '',
'twitter.accessToken' => '',
'twitter.accessTokenSecret' => ''
```

Continue with the following commands:

```
# run migrations
./yii migrate

# fill RBAC
./yii rbac/up

# build contributors page (this may take some time as it downloads a lot of user avatars from github)
./yii contributors/generate

# build js/css files
gulp build

# If you're on Windows you have to manually symlink or copy
# %appdata%/npm/node_modules/browser-sync to your app's node_modules

# The next step is for building the API documentation and the Guide files.
# It is optional for the site to be working but you will have no API docs and Guide.
# This step includes cloning the Yii 1 and Yii 2 repositories and a lot of computation,
# so you might want to skip it on the first install.
#
# This also requires an instance of elasticsearch to be configured and running
# (if you do not have it, it will still run, but the site search will not work).
# It also assumes you have pdflatex installed for building PDF guide docs.
#
# You may also build only parts of the docs, run  make help  for the available commands.
make docs

# populate the search index by running
./yii search/rebuild
```

### Web Server Setup

Define a host name `yiiframework.local` that points to `localhost`.

Define a virtual host `yiiframework.local` which uses `yiiframework.com/web` as its document root.

If you are using Apache, add the following configuration for the `yiiframework.com/web` folder to hide the
entry script:

```
RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
```

### Data Import

For importing data from the old website, the following steps are necessary:

- import data by running `./yii import` command
- rebuild user badges by running `./yii badge/rebuild` 
- calculate user ranking `./yii user/ranking`.

If you don't have that data, you can work with dummy content:

- To fill the database with dummy content, you may run the command `./yii fake-data`.
  You may run it multiple times to generate more data.
- rebuild user badges by running `./yii badge/rebuild`.
- calculate user ranking `./yii user/ranking`.

To assign users extra permissions use `./yii rbac/assign`.

### Cron jobs


The following commands need to be set up to run on a regular basis:

| command                   | interval | Purpose
| --------------------      | -------- | --
| yii sitemap/generate      | daily    | regenerate sitemap.xml
| yii contributors/generate | weekly   | update contributors list on team page
| yii badge/update          | hourly   | update badges for users in badge_queue
| yii cron/update-packagist | hourly   | update packagist extension data
| yii user/ranking          | daily    | update user ranking

Additionally, `queue/listen` should run as a daemon or `queue/run` as a cronjob.


### DEPLOYMENT

This section covers notes for deployment on a server, you may not need this for your dev env. OS is assumed to be debian Stretch.

```
apt-get install texlive-full git nodejs make
```

## Maintenance

The contributors list and the avatar thumbnails is generated by a console command:

    ./yii contributors/generate

It will connect to Github via the API and fetch a list of contributors, generate `data/contributors.json` and thumbnail images of the user avatars in `data/avatars` and finally invoke Gulp to generate a sprite image and Sass code.

It would be a good idea to set up a Cron job to run that once in a while - perhaps once each month.

If you generate a personal Github token (from your Github profile settings section) you can tell the contributors/generate function to make use of it by creating a file in the `data` directory (@app/data) called `github.token` with the token pasted into it (one line, no line-break). That should solve most issues related to the API rate limit imposed by Github.

## DEVELOPMENT

### Build

* During development, run `gulp` to watch view, Sass and JS file changes and automatically build target CSS/JS files. This command will also launch a browser window which is connected to browsersync.
* At any time, run `gulp build` to manually rebuild target CSS/JS files from source Sass/JS files.
* If you only want to watch for changes, you can issue the command `gulp watch`
* To build the assets for production, specify the `production` flag: `gulp build --production`

### CSS Files

* Use Sass files to define CSS styles.
* All Sass files should be put under `assets/src/scss` and listed in `assets/src/scss/all.scss`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single Sass file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a Sass file named `_guide.scss`.
* All Sass source files, except `all.scss` should have a leading underscore in the name. Sass will ignore files starting with an underscore so that only one CSS file will be produced (all.css).
* For information about where each file should be put, please consult the master include file `all.scss`.


### JS Files

* All JS files should be put under `assets/src/js` and listed in `config.yml`.
* Usually each controller corresponds to a single JS file whose name is the same as the controller ID.
  For example, the `GuideController` has a JS file named `guide.js`.
